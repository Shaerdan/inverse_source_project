# Inverse Source Project - Session Journal

## Session 3: January 1, 2026 (v7.6)
File: session_summary_2026-01-01.md
Package: inverse_source_v7.6.zip
Topics:
- CRITICAL: Peak-based RMSE was misleading (threshold-dependent, showed overfit as "good")
- NEW: localization_score() - measures intensity near true sources (0-1, higher=better)
- NEW: sparsity_ratio() - measures solution concentration (0-1, higher=sparser)
- TV implementation verified against cvxpy reference (NOT a bug)
- Key finding: L2/TV have HIGHER localization, L1 has HIGHER sparsity
- All linear methods spread intensity everywhere (localization ~0.1-0.3)
